# 🚗 Linear Regression – CO₂ Emissions Prediction

This project uses **linear regression** to explore and predict **CO₂ emissions** of vehicles based on their **engine size**.

---

## 📘 Project Description

The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between a vehicle’s **engine size** and the **amount of CO₂ it emits**.  

We utilize Python libraries such as:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for building and training the machine learning model

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Dataset used:** `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`
- **Features used:**
  - `ENGINESIZE` — Size of the vehicle engine (in liters)
  - `CO2EMISSIONS` — Carbon dioxide emissions (in grams per kilometer)

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

- `work.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow (data loading, visualization, and model training).
- `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv` — Dataset file (should be in the same directory).

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the necessary Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
